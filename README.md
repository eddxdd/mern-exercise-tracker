MERN Stack project. The purpose of this project was to merge my knowledge of backend and frontend with a simple database and CRUD functionality, created with React and NodeJS.

To start the website:

- Clone the repo
- "cd backend/" and "nodemon server"
- "npm start"

Make sure you install all the dependencies, etc; first.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
